# User
- Cart Management: Users can add, remove, and adjust products in their cart.
- Checkout: Users can proceed to checkout, transforming their cart into an order with an "In Progress" status.
- Order Tracking: Users can view the status of their orders.
- Delete Cart Items: Once a cart is checked out, the cart items from that cart cannot be removed. Thus, a soft delete can be used.

# Add Item to Cart and Checkout:
Only a registered user can add an item to the cart. Once the cart is checked out, it will immediately become an order, and no item from that cart can be deletedâ€”only soft deleted.

# Membership:
There are three different levels of membership: Bronze (no discount), Silver (15% discount if your total purchase exceeds 15), and Gold (30% discount if total purchase exceeds 30)
