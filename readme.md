This E-commerce application is focused on backend functionality. Initially, you will need to populate data using the API, and ensure you include the admin's password when sending requests due to security reasons. An admin interface with comprehensive CRUD functionalities is provided. For a detailed view of the API endpoints and functionalities, check the Swagger documentation at (localhost:3000/doc).

# Features

# User
Cart Management: Users can add, remove, and adjust products in their cart.
Checkout: Users can proceed to checkout, transforming their cart into an order with an "In Progress" status.
Order Tracking: Users can view the status of their orders.
Delete Cart Items: Once a cart is checked out, the cart items from that cart cannot be removed. Thus, a soft delete can be used.
